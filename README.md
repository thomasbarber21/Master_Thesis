My Masters Thesis explores the NYC Congestion Charge, analyzing whether it is working in a conventional sense. I then also analyze the policy's impact on crime within the city.

This is done through a few Causal Inference Techniques:
1. Synthetic Control is utilized to analyze the policy's impact on PM2.5 pollution in the city, as well as on EZ Pass toll data. This allows me to create a synthetic control group for the
   Manhattan Central Business District to compare to current readings on pollution or speed.
2. Difference in Difference was then used to compare arrest data in Manhattan's business district to a control group, consisting of upper Manhattan and the other four boroughs. Through this
   I am able to analyze the impact of the policy on crime. It is then taken a step further in analyzing arrest data based on its distance from public transportation, to gain insights on
   crime migration.

This thesis is still a work in progress, but I have included my R script files and some outputs for reference. Note: once completed I will upload the data and table results for reproducibility.
